# wartales-tips

Tooltips on the Wartales new-game **start choice** screen. Hover an item in the
starting-troop preview to see the game's own item tooltip; hover a unit line
("class + trait") to see that class's base skills as the game's skill tooltips.

Nothing new is drawn: the patch rewires the existing `ui.comp.Element` hover
tooltip system onto the preview's `ItemIcon` and `TextFixed` children and adds two
small functions (`ItemTip(icon.item)`, a vertical `Flow` of `SkillTip` per
`unitClass.baseSkills` entry) to the game's HashLink bytecode (`hlboot.dat`).

It also carries one gameplay patch, **enemy friendly fire**: an area attack
cast by a non-player unit also hits that unit's own allies (never the caster),
the way player area attacks already work. Only the area loop of
`Skill.gatherTargets` changes (`src/friendly_fire.rs`): for a skill whose
`allowedTargets` is Enemies it passes `checkValid = false` to
`SkillEval.addTarget` for every targetable unit other than the caster, so
primary-target choice and AI target selection still use the original
`Unit.isValidTarget`. Always on, no toggle.

## Install

Two ways, pick one:

1. **Bundled in [wartales-mp](https://github.com/UberMorgott/Wartales-Mod-wartales-mp)**
   (recommended): the co-op mod's `winmm.dll` links this patcher and applies it
   to the copy of the bytecode it already hands the game. Nothing in the game
   folder is modified. If the game build differs, the tooltips are silently
   skipped and everything else keeps working (`shim.log`: `tips: not applied`).
2. **Standalone** (`dist\`): run `install.cmd`. It finds the Steam install, keeps
   `hlboot.dat.orig` / `sdlboot.dat.orig` backups and writes the patched files.
   `uninstall.cmd` restores the backups. Re-run `install.cmd` after a game update.

## Build

```powershell
cargo build --release                                   # wartales-tips.exe (CLI)
cargo build --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu    # libwartales_tips.a for the mp DLL
.\target\release\wartales-tips.exe patch <in.dat> <out.dat>
.\target\release\wartales-tips.exe inspect <in.dat> ui.comp.Element
```

`vendor\hlbc` is hlbc 0.7.0 with two fixes so that reading and writing the
bytecode is byte-identical (see `vendor\NOTICE.md`). Every lookup in the patcher
is by name (types, fields, methods), never by index, so a game update either
patches cleanly or fails with a clear message.
